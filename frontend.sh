# Here we need to create webserver service called nginx, which can also acts as load balancer upon our configuring the nginx and its default config files.
# we need to donwload the frontend or web server code in the /html file by deleting any content if existing.
# then need to config the expense.conf file which is additional config file in nginx directory, that expense.conf consiste the backend server private ip details to fetch, communicate and update with mysql database.
# finally after configuring the nginx configs, need to restart its service.

# Make sure while donwloading the content in html file, need to delete its existing everytime when runs this script.
